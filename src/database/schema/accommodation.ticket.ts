// active means room is on hold, expired means no longer on hold. booked means the user has paid and the room is now booked.
// NOTE: currently tickets are only used for testing, so only roomId, buildingId, ownedBy, status are required.

// when a user sends a get request on a room. the room is checked for active tickets. if there are any, then the user is shown that the room is on hold.
// at that time, if previous ticket is expired, it will be disassociated from the room and the room will be available again.
// this process will not be done via a cron job, but will be done on the fly when a user requests a room. although, a cron job can be added later.
